# Weather App â€“ Swift Practice Project

This Weather App was created as a practice project to learn the basics of Swift and iOS UI development. The current version focuses only on the user interface and does not connect to any weather API yet.

The app features a clean and simple layout that displays sample weather data. One of the key elements is the **"Change Day Time"** button, which is intended to switch the UI theme to dark mode, allowing users to experience both day and night views.

### ðŸ”§ What This Code Covers:
- Building UI using Swift and SwiftUI components
- Basic layout and styling
- Button interaction (UI-based only)
- Theme switching logic placeholder

This project is a work in progress and is mainly focused on understanding how to build and structure an iOS app UI using Swift.

Feel free to explore, fork, or build upon it!
